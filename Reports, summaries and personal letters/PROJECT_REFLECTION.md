# 💭 Project Reflection / מכתב אישי

הפרויקט הזה בער בי כבר זמן רב. היה בי את הרצון העז לפרוץ לפלאפון ולייצר לעצמי מקצת ההבנה לגבי מערך האבטחה בפלאפונים האישיים.

הפרויקט הזה היה בשבילי תענוג גדול. חוויתי קשיים ותקלות לכל אורך הדרך, אבל עדיין שקדתי, למדתי, חקרתי – ואני חושב שבסוף גם הבנתי מעט מהעולם המורכב הזה.

עבורי, זה לא היה סתם "עוד פרויקט" להגשה, אלא משימה ארוכה שראיתי את הצורך לחוות ולכבוש בעצמי. ההתמודדות עם בניית השרת, כתיבת האפליקציה והפריצה הידנית לימדה אותי יותר מכל קורס תיאורטי.

### English Version
This project has been a passion of mine for a long time. I had a strong desire to understand mobile security deeply and to challenge myself by compromising a mobile device in a controlled environment.

This journey was a great pleasure for me. I experienced difficulties and technical hurdles all along the way, but I persisted, researched, and learned. In the end, I believe I have gained a real understanding of this complex landscape.

For me, this was not just a project for a grade, but a long-term mission I felt the need to conquer. Dealing with building the server, coding the application, and executing the manual exploits taught me more than any theoretical course could.
