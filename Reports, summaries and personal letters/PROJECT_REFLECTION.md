# 💭 Project Reflection / מכתב אישי

הפרויקט הזה בער בי כבר זמן רב. היה בי את הרצון העז לפרוץ לפלאפון ולייצר לעצמי מקצת ההבנה לגבי מערך האבטחה בפלאפונים האישיים.

הפרויקט הזה היה בשבילי תענוג גדול. חוויתי קשיים ותקלות לכל אורך הדרך, אבל עדיין שקדתי, למדתי, חקרתי – ואני חושב שבסוף גם הבנתי מעט מהעולם המורכב הזה.

עבורי, זה לא היה סתם "עוד פרויקט" להגשה, אלא משימה ארוכה שראיתי את הצורך לחוות ולכבוש בעצמי. ההתמודדות עם בניית השרת, כתיבת האפליקציה והפריצה הידנית לימדה אותי יותר מכל קורס תיאורטי.
הסיפור שרציתי לספר זה על חברה תמימה אך כנראה לא מקצועית במיוחד, שייצרה אפליקציה לאנשים עם קשיי ראיה. האפליקציה קוראת מהמסך בקול לאותם אנשים ובכך עוזרת להם במוגבלותם. אך הם לא יודעים כי אישור של ההרשאת נגישות יוכל בסופו של דבר ליצור פתח ולדלוף החוצה עקב חוסר אחריות ועבודה לא טובה של החברה.
מקווה שנהנת מהסיפור שלי.

### English Version
This project has been a passion of mine for a long time. I had a strong desire to understand mobile security deeply and to challenge myself by compromising a mobile device in a controlled environment.

This journey was a great pleasure for me. I experienced difficulties and technical hurdles all along the way, but I persisted, researched, and learned. In the end, I believe I have gained a real understanding of this complex landscape.

For me, this was not just a project for a grade, but a long-term mission I felt the need to conquer. Dealing with building the server, coding the application, and executing the manual exploits taught me more than any theoretical course could.
company that developed an application for people with visual impairments. The application reads the screen out loud to those users and helps them with their limitation. But they do not know that granting the accessibility permission could eventually create an opening and leak data outward, due to the company's lack of responsibility and poor work.
I hope you enjoyed my story.
